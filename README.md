## To install MPI:

*sudo apt-get install libcr-dev mpich2 mpich2-doc*

If the instalation was sucessfull, it should be possible to execute *mpich2version* command

---

If both *mpich2* and *mpich2-doc* where not found, try these:

*sudo apt-get install libcr-dev mpich mpich-doc*

Again, if the instalation was sucessfull, it should be possible to execute 'mpichversion' command
